Project Final Report can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1orzkxrAJnuR5l4xsoyoLFd2mdwO5lPoIeUN6GW_ZBug/edit#heading=h.3y0xupptcbvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Unfortunately the shared drive where our project work lie is privated, so I am unable to share some of our work there. However, the final report hopefully is able to answer any questions regarding the Smart Composter's intended functionality, as well as our process while creating this prototype.
